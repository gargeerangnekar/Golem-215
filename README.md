Project: Lunar Rock Image Classification using Machine Learning

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to classify images of lunar rocks as "small" or "large", automating a crucial task for lunar research.

Data Provided: Utilized a comprehensive dataset of lunar rock images and a training CSV with image IDs and classifications. The test set included unclassified images for model prediction.

Significance: Enabled rapid analysis of lunar surface materials, aiding in site selection for further exploration and supporting future lunar missions.

Training Data Insight: Analyzed a diverse range of rock sizes and formations, overcoming challenges in visual classification between the two classes.

Image Normalization: Standardized all images to a uniform size and scale, ensuring consistency during model training.

Augmentation: Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming) to reduce overfitting and enhance model robustness.

Segmentation: Used image segmentation to improve accuracy by isolating rocks from the lunar surface, directing the modelâ€™s focus to relevant features.
